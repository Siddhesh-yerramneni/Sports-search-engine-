The White Ferns have already sealed the series having won the first two games comprehensively and they would now be aiming for a clean sweep. At the same time, the hosts would also want to ensure that they do not get complacent in any manner.New Zealand have been totally outstanding both with the bat and ball. Their best performance so far was during the opening fixture where they skittled out the Asia side for a paltry 32 runs as they successfully defended 164 to come out on top by a mammoth margin on 132 runs.The Bangladeshis on the other hand have a lot of work to do and need to fight hard in this dead-rubber contest to salvage pride by registering a consolation win. A victory here would go a long way in boosting their morale ahead of the upcoming three One Day Internationals against the same opposition.Venue: John Davies Oval, QueenstownDate and Time: December 7, 6:30 AM ISTTelecast: Sony Sports Network and Sony LIVThe wicket at the John Davies surface is expected to be a balanced one.
