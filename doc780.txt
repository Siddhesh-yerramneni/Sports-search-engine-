Follow us onThe final of the T20 World Cup 2022 between Pakistan and England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday (November 13) saw a massive crowd arriving and it was a tournament to cherish for the England fans. Ben Stokes yet again stepped up at a crucial moment for England with an unbeaten half-century and showed immense ability to perform at the biggest of stages. All in all, England have taken a giant stride in limited-overs cricket and have added another T20 World Cup title to their cabinet. For Pakistan, the team had their chances especially in the first innings, where they could have piled up more runs at the back end of the game and could have put England under more pressure with their world-class bowling lineup in action. However, the batting department did not click well, and the injury to Shaheen Afridi did not help the situation.  After the World Cup ended, legendary Indian batter Sachin Tendulkar tweeted praises for England and shared his thoughts on Afridi’s injury, which proved to be vital in England’s trophy win. Congratulations England on winning your 2nd @T20WorldCup. 🏆Fantastic achievement. 👏🏻 It was a closely fought final and would’ve been even more interesting had Afridi not been injured.What a roller coaster of a World Cup. #T20WorldCupFinal pic.twitter.com/1rNyFO7L7T

"Congratulations England on winning your 2nd @T20WorldCup. Fantastic achievement. It was a closely fought final and would’ve been even more interesting had Afridi not been injured. What a roller coaster of a World Cup," Tendulkar tweeted. Harry Brook took the aerial route against the bowling of Shadab Khan in the 13th over and Afridi took a brilliant catch while running in to dismiss the youngster. However, Afridi hurt his knee during the process and was down on the ground.He came back to bowl the 16th over and walked off the field in agony after bowling just one delivery. The over was completed by Iftikhar Ahmed, who conceded 13 in his five balls and it changed the game completely in England’s favour.  © 2013 - 2022 CricTracker Pvt Ltd All rights reserved.
