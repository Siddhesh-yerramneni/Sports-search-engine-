Follow us onPreviewSouth Africa will lock horns with Bangladesh in Match 22 of the T20 World Cup 2022 on Thursday in Sydney. In their last outing, Proteas were involved in a rain-abandoned fixture against Zimbabwe, which ended as a no result. Although they were just 13 runs away from a victory, the rain gods could not be kind enough to allow the action to be continued. The likes of Quinton de Kock and Lungi Ngidi were their top performers in this game.Bangladesh, on the other hand, started off on a positive note in the tournament. They scored 144, with contributions from Afif Hossain and Najmul Hossain Shanto. Then Taskin Ahmed led from the front to bundle out the Netherlands for a score of 135 and win the game by nine runs. It will be interesting to see if Proteas can get off the mark in the showpiece event.Match InformationICC Men's T20 World Cup, 27 Oct 2022, Thur, 8:30 AM IST,  SydneyProbable Playing XISouth AfricaT Bavuma(C), AK Markram, DA Miller, RR Rossouw, T Stubbs, WD Parnell, Q de Kock, KA Maharaj, L Ngidi, A Nortje, K RabadaBench : H Klaasen, RR Hendricks, Dwaine Pretorius, T Shamsi, AL Phehlukwayo, M Jansen, LB Williams, BC FortuinBangladeshYasir Ali, Nazmul Hossain Shanto, Afif Hossain, M Hossain, Soumya Sarkar, Shakib Al Hasan(C), Liton Das, Nurul Hasan, Mustafizur Rahman, Taskin Ahmed, Hasan MahmudBench : Sabbir Rahman, Mehidy Hasan Miraz, M Saifuddin, Ebadot Hossain, Nasum Ahmed, Shoriful Islam, Mahedi Hasan, Rishad HossainInjury and availability newsWeather ReportWin PredictionPitch ConditionAvg 1st Inning ScorePitch ReportPlayer PicksAfif Hossain BAN |  BATAfif emerged as the top contributor of the team in the last game, wherein he garnered 38 off 27 balls.Quinton de Kock SA |  WKThe prolific batter remained unbeaten on 47* off 18 balls in his latest outing and will be a key pick for your fantasy team.Taskin Ahmed BAN |  BOWLThe right-arm pacer shone brightly to finish with figures of 4/25 in the last game and can wreak havoc in this fixture as well.Avoid Having These Players In Your Fantasy Sports TeamKeshav MaharajSA |  BOWLMaharaj has not been effective enough in the T20Is.In the last game, he bowled a solitary over and conceded 10 runs.Yasir Ali ChowdhuryBAN |  BATYasir has been inconsistent in his international career.
