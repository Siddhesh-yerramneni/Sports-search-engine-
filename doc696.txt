Bulls mark their presence in the fourth position with a single victory in three appearances. In their last outing, they could score only 94 and were ordinary with the ball in their failed attempt to defend the score. The likes of Tom Banton and Tim David will be critical for them in this game. Gladiators, on the other hand, have done well to secure two victories in three games and are in the second position in the table. Their last outing witnessed the team posting 109 on the board. However, a lacklustre bowling effort caused them to the game. Players like Nicholas Pooran and Tom Helm have been their best performers. ReserveReserve© 2013 - 2022 CricTracker Pvt Ltd All rights reserved.
