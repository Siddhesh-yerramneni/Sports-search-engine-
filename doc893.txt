Follow us onBig Bash League franchise Perth Scorchers head coach Adam Voges is hopeful that pacer Jhye Richardson will join the squad in the initial matches of the forthcoming season. Richardson suffered a heel injury that kept him on the sidelines and is currently recovering.The pacer on Saturday, failed a fitness test on his bruised heel as he was to join Western Australia for the Sheffield Shield clash with Queensland. Scorchers coach Adam Voges opined that the player has time despite the ‘frustrating’ injury keeping him away from game for quite a while.“It’s really unfortunate for Jhye at the moment. I’ve been in really close contact with him and we’re talking regularly about how it’s going and this heel is just lingering and being a nuisance really. He can do most things, he can run, he can sprint, he can bowl at half to three-quarter pace, but as soon as he has to actually get up to full intensity and slam his foot into the ground, that heel is just not coping and it’s nothing other than just a bit of time to let it heal and let it settle,” the coach told The West Australian.The coach further added that the player is recovering and will return to the side’s title defence ahead of the new season. The Scorchers begin their campaign as they play Sydney Sixers in their first match of the BBL 12 on Saturday, December 17.“It’s certainly frustrating for Jhye but he’s still got time on his side, he’s still young and there’s still plenty of opportunities ahead of him and I think he sees that longer picture. We’re trying to get him up and ready to go for the Scorchers now, that’s the next time frame that we’re working towards and hopefully we’ll see a fair bit of him during the BBL," the coach concluded.© 2013 - 2022 CricTracker Pvt Ltd All rights reserved.
