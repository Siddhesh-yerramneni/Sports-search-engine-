He maintains a 50-plus average in T20I format and has scored a century and two fifties in his last five innings.Cameron Green AUS |  ALLGreen proved costly with the ball despite taking the big wicket of Suryakumar Yadav but smashed 61 runs off 30 balls to give Australia a flying start in the last match. He will be a good captaincy choice if he starts the innings for Australia in this fixture as well.Glenn Maxwell AUS |  ALLThe star all-rounder failed to make any impact with both bat and ball in the opening match but ranks sixth in the ICC T20 All-rounders chart and has a big experience of playing in Indian conditions. He has scored 2018 runs in 88 T20I innings at an average of 30.11 and an impressive economy rate of 153.11 so far.Avoid Having These Players In Your Fantasy Sports TeamDinesh KarthikIND |  WKThe veteran wicketkeeper batter continues to struggle with another disappointing knock in the last match. Karthik has scored only 33 runs in his last five T20I innings and should be avoided for your Dream11 team.Yuzvendra ChahalIND |  BOWLThe star leg-spinner remains the key bowler for India but is struggling for consistency with just five wickets in his last five T20I innings.
