Follow us onPreviewNew Zealand will lock horns with India in the third fixture of the T20I series at McLean Park, Napier. The last T20I witnessed India posting a mammoth score of 191 on the board with a whirlwind century from Suryakumar Yadav. For New Zealand, Tim Southee grabbed a hat-trick and was the pick of the bowlers. In response to the stiff chase, Kiwi batters succumbed to the pressure against the skillful bowling attack of the visitors. The likes of Deepak Hooda and Yuzvendra Chahal were impressive with their performances with the ball for India. In this game, Mark Chapman has replaced Kane Williamson and is likely to play this game. On the other hand, India are also expected to have some changes in their lineup.Match InformationIndia tour of New Zealand, 22 Nov 2022, Tue, 12:00 PM IST,  NapierProbable Playing XINew ZealandDevon Conway, Finn Allen, DJ Mitchell, Mitchell Santner, James Neesham, MS Chapman, Glenn Phillips, Tim Southee(C), LH Ferguson, AF Milne, Ish SodhiBench : Kane Williamson, Michael Bracewell, BM TicknerIndiaHH Pandya(C), SA Yadav, S Iyer, Deepak Hooda, Washington Sundar, Rishabh Pant, Ishan Kishan, Yuzvendra Chahal, Arshdeep Singh, Mohammed Siraj, B KumarBench : Shubman Gill, SV Samson, KL Yadav, HV Patel, Umran Malik, Shikhar Dhawan, Shardul Thakur, DL Chahar, Shahbaz Ahmed, KR SenInjury and availability newsWeather ReportWin PredictionPitch ConditionAvg 1st Inning ScorePitch ReportPlayer PicksSuryakumar Yadav IND |  BATSurya unleashed another fantastic knock in the last game, wherein he scored 111* off 51 balls.
