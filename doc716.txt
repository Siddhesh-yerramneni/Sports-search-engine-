It is sufficient to establish that the Minimum Over Rate was not met. To avoid liability under this offence the fielding team would need to establish, on the balance of probabilities, that the shortfall was due to factors beyond their control and that the time allowances permitted by the Match Officials in calculating the required over rate were not sufficient. The presence or absence of subjective intent and the extent of the shortfall shall be relevant in relation to the issue of penalty.© 2013 - 2022 CricTracker Pvt Ltd All rights reserved.
