He has the ability to clock speeds of over 145 kmph consistently and has rattled top-draw batters with his fiery pace. The 26-year-old has featured in 63 games in the shortest format and bagged 79 wickets at an economy of 8.39.Mumbai Indians signed the speedster for the 2022 season of the lucrative T20 tournament. Meredith played eight games and fared well with the ball picking as many wickets at an economy of 8.43. However, the Australian pacer was not part of Mumbai’s scheme of things going forward as the five-time IPL champions released him ahead of the upcoming edition.The ace pacer will go under the hammer at the IPL 2023 auction and many franchises might show interest in picking him at the marquee event.
