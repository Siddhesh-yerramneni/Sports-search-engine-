Follow us onAfter the grand success of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) 2022, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Ramiz Raja has proposed a new model which according to him will take the country’s franchise T20 league to even greater heights. The 1992 World Cup-winning player is looking forward to replacing the draft system with the auction model starting next year.Meanwhile, Raja has also found support from veteran Pakistan all-rounder Shoaib Malik. Giving further clarification on the same, Malik said that the auction model will be very handy in attracting big players in the future. At the same time, he has also mentioned that this innovative strategy will go a long way in further increasing the PSL’s brand value.“We have taken giant strides in making HBL PSL better, but if we have to take it to the IPL level, then we should consider moving from the drafting to auction model to attract the biggest stars of the game,” said Malik while speaking to CricWick.“I know IPL is a developed product, and it started many years before PSL, but I feel that we can now move towards this model to increase the brand value further. We can put a limitation on the salary cap or something, but this is the need of the hour,” he added.Meanwhile, the profit of this year’s PSL jumped to 71 percent which is the most in the history of the competition ever since its inception in 2016. The Multan Sultans were the defending champions and made a consecutive final appearance but, went down to the Lahore Qalandars by 42 runs.Even Shoaib Malik had participated in this year’s Pakistan Super League. In fact, he finished as the fourth-highest run-getter in the competition having amassed 401 runs from 11 matches averaging 44.55 and a strike rate of 137.32. He played a key role in Peshawar Zalmi making the knockouts where they lost to Islamabad United in Eliminator one.© 2013 - 2022 CricTracker Pvt Ltd All rights reserved.
