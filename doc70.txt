Follow us onThe upcoming sixteenth season of the Indian Premier League (IPL) is already making headlines with the mini-auction around the corner that is reportedly set to be held on December 16. Like every year, the auction phase promises to be another frantic affair.All the IPL franchises have been asked to submit their list of retained players ahead of the mini auction on November 15. The teams must be ideating plans on whom to keep and whom to leave out.Arguably one of the best sides in the IPL, the Chennai Super Kings endured a dismal campaign in the 2022 edition. The Chennai-based franchise lost ten of their 14-group stage matches along with the most decorated side of the IPL, the Rohit Sharma-led Mumbai Indians.However, with the previous season done and dusted, CSK have a chance to redeem themselves this season starting with the auction by rebuilding the squad.The England pacer is known to add threat with his fearsome yorkers and is hailed as a death specialist in T20 cricket. CSK acquired the services of the speedster at the 2022 IPL auction in the hope that he will be able to dismiss batters in the crunch moments of the matches.However, the Chennai-based club could not see the best of the player due to his poor outings with the side. The player was unable to make his mark in the domestic circuit that has created a big question mark on whether the club will retain the player this season.In his four outings with the club, he leaked a lot of runs with an economy of 10.52 and was only able to scalp two wickets. This has put the player in the backfoot ahead of the auction and could very well be on his way out of the club.Â© 2013 - 2022 CricTracker Pvt Ltd All rights reserved.
