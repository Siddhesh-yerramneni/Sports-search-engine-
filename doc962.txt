Follow us onAustralia claimed a convincing victory over West Indies in the first Test, winning by 164 runs. The hosts dominated the game for three days straight before the visitors grabbed an upper hand on the fourth day, courtesy of skipper Kraigg Brathwaite’s magnificent century. But he could not carry the same momentum on the final day, which led to Australia getting back in the driver’s seat and eventually winning the game.Skipper Pat Cummins won the toss and elected to bat first, and his decision worked really well for the hosts as Australia took command from the very beginning. Though West Indies managed to pick up an early wicket, when Jayden Seales dismissed David Warner, the bowlers could not do much after handing Australia the early blow.The innings was then dominated by Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith as the duo notched up their respective double-hundreds before Australia declared at 598/4 on the second day of the Test. West Indies started off well as openers Kraigg Brathwaite and Tagenarine Chanderpaul notched up half-centuries, but their dismissal added misery to West Indies’ run and they were dismissed for 283 runs, giving Australia the lead.In their second innings too, Australia rode on Labuschagne’s red-hot form as he amassed another century before Australia declared the second innings, scoring 182/2. The hosts had a massive 497-run lead before West Indies started with their final chase. With almost two days in hand, the visitors started off on a high note as openers Brathwaite and Tagenarine Chanderpaul shared a 116-run stand.The West Indies skipper slammed a ton before the end of the fourth day, but he could not continue the momentum on the final day and was dismissed by Nathan Lyon. West Indies lost plenty of wickets on the final day before Roston Chase and Alzarri Joseph steadied the ship with their 82-run stand for the eighth wicket. But their efforts went in vain as Lyon did the work with the ball and Australia bagged a 164-run victory.With the win, Australia continue to stand tall on top of the points table with 72.73 percentage points.
