Follow us onPreviewTrinbago Knight Riders will lock horns with Guyana Amazon Warriors in Match 18 of CPL 2022 at Gros Islet. Knight Riders are languishing at bottom of the points table with a solitary win in five league matches. In their last outing, the batting line-up again crumbled, and they could score 132, and then failed to defend the total. The likes of Nicholas Pooran and Sunil Narine will be their key players.On the other hand, the Warriors also have a single win in four games and are in the penultimate position at the table. In their last fixture, their bowling effort was average to concede 161, but the batting unit comprising Heinrick Klaasen and Shimron Hetmyer inspired them to their maiden win. It will be interesting to see whether they can continue the dominance in this game as well.Match InformationCaribbean Premier League, 14 Sep 2022, Wed, 4:30 AM IST,  Port of SpainProbable Playing XITrinbago Knight RidersC Munro, T Webster, Kieron Pollard(C), SP Narine, Khary Pierre, AD Russell, Nicholas Pooran, Tim Seifert, Shaaron Lewis, R Rampaul, DM DupavillonBench : T Hinds, AJ Hosein, Leonardo Julien, A Phillip, S Prasanna, Jayden Seales, M TheekshanaGuyana Amazon WarriorsChandrapaul Hemraj, Shimron Hetmyer(C), CA Ingram, Keemo Paul, Romario Shepherd, Shai Hope, H Klaasen, Imran Tahir, G Moti-Kanhai, T Shamsi, Odean SmithBench : RR Beaton, Jermaine Blackwood, Matthew Nandu, V Permaul, Junior Sinclair, PR StirlingInjury and availability newsWeather ReportWin PredictionPitch ConditionAvg 1st Inning ScorePitch ReportPlayer PicksShimron Hetmyer GAW |  BATThe Warriors skipper has been consistent with his contributions to slam 117 runs in three innings, with 46 as the top score.Heinrich Klaasen GAW |  WKThe proficient batter was exquisite with his knock of 61* off 46 in the last game, taking his tally to 93 runs.Nicholas Pooran TKR |  WKThe swashbuckling ball-striker played a matured knock of 52 off 43 balls in his latest outing and has 77 runs in four innings.Avoid Having These Players In Your Fantasy Sports TeamKieron PollardTKR |  ALLThe experienced campaigner has been dismal with only 30 runs in four innings.Romario ShepherdGAW |  ALLShepherd has picked only three wickets in as many appearances at an economy of 10.90.Last Updated On  - Dec 6 2022 4:00 PM More PredictionsNoteDisclaimerÂ© 2013 - 2022 CricTracker Pvt Ltd All rights reserved.
