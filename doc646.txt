Follow us onThe game between South Africa and the Netherlands turned out to be one of the major upsets of the tournament as the Dutch side went on to defeat the Proteas and put curtains on their T20 World Cup 2022 campaign. South Africa, who were just a win away from confirming a semi-final spot, had to face an unfortunate exit from the tournament.After posting a target of 159 runs to chase, the Netherlands bowlers kept the South African batters in check and under control, thereby restricting them from chasing the total.
