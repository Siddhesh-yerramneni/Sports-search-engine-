Follow us onThe duo of Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan is among the most prolific opening pairs in the history of ODI cricket. They have been starting the proceedings with the bat for the Men in Blue since 2013 and have notched up an insane tally of 5125 runs in 114 innings at an average of 45.75. The veteran pair is presently India’s first-choice opening combination for the 50-overs format and the same will likely be the case till the 2023 ODI World Cup. However, with the Men in Blue playing an awful lot of cricket in the lead-up to the next year's marquee tournament, it might not be possible for Rohit and Shikhar to play each and every game. Thus, fans could witness the team management fielding different opening combinations in the near future.Shubman Gill has been India’s go-to man for the opening slot in the ODIs whenever either Rohit or Dhawan has been unavailable, and the ace batter has performed outstandingly well. The 23-year-old has featured in 14 games in the 50-over format and aggregated 674 runs at a superb strike rate of 100.44. Thus, the Men in Blue are likely to give him more game time in the opening position.When talking about a candidate to partner with Gill at the top, it is quite tough to look beyond Ruturaj Gaikwad. The Maharashtra batter has been a run machine in the Indian domestic circuit and amassed 3758 runs in 70 List-A games at an average of 58.71. Gaikwad has been in a pristine touch of late and accumulated an insane tally of 552 runs in four matches played thus far at the ongoing Vijay Hazare Trophy 2022, which includes a blistering double century against Uttar Pradesh.There is elegance written all over Gill and Gaikwad and the duo can put any bowling attack under the pump with its marauding bat. Both batters are adept at playing spin and pace, and have the ability to swiftly switch gears. And given they are in phenomenal nick, one can witness the two batters opening the innings for India in the build-up to the next year’s World Cup.© 2013 - 2022 CricTracker Pvt Ltd All rights reserved.
