Follow us onThe first Test match of the series between hosts Australia and the West Indies moved towards an intriguing finale after an eventful fourth day in Perth. Marnus Labuschagne followed his double century from the first innings with another glittering century to hand Australia a massive lead before the Caribbean skipper Kraigg Brathwaite replied with a sensational century of his own to keep the visitors in the match.Australian batting sensation Marnus Labuschagne, along with veteran opening batter David Warner scored briskly to further solidify the hosts' commanding position in the morning session. The southpaw fell just two short of a well-deserved half-century. However, Labuschagne continued his assault on the Windies bowlers after surviving a fierce bowling spell from Alzarri Joseph with a bit of good fortune. The 28-year-old went on to register his ninth Test ton in the second innings, becoming only the eighth batter to register a double century and a century in the same Test match. His swashbuckling 104* off just 110 deliveries propelled Australia to 182/2, taking their lead to a massive 497 runs.The Windies knew the stern task at hand as they needed to bat for nearly two days in front of a menacing Australian bowling attack to avoid a defeat in the series opener. However, their assignment got a bit easier after Australian skipper Pat Cummins did not walk out to bowl due to a quadriceps injury. Steve Smith, who stood in for the injured Cummins, was frustrated by the West Indian openers, who notched up a solid 116 runs opening stand. Tagenarine Chanderpaul, who batted beautifully in the first innings of his Test debut, fell short of another half-century in the match after playing a lazy shot off Mitchell Starc on 45.The incoming Shamarh Brooks did not last too long at the crease as Australian bowlers sensed an opening in the fourth innings of the match. However, their plans were thwarted by the Windies skipper Kraigg Brathwaite who continued his impeccable touch from the first innings. The opening batter showed dogged determination to compile a memorable fourth innings century to keep his team's chances alive in the contest.The Aussie bowlers toiled hard for another wicket, and their efforts paid dividends as  Labuschagne grabbed a one-handed stunner to hand Australia a much-needed breakthrough just before the end of the day's play. West Indies finished the day on 192/3, with a day's play remaining in the first Test match of the series. Australia are slightly ahead at the moment, but with Kraigg Brathwaite holding fort at one end and the injury to Pat Cummins making for an intriguing contest on the final day.Back to Perth brilliant fighting 💯 from Kraigg Brathwaite, West Indies showing some real fight. #AUSvWILast 11 test centuries by a West Indies opening batsman; all to Kraigg Brathwaite.
