With two consecutive ducks in the recently concluded ODI series against the Netherlands, more speculations started to gather pace regarding his future in the English team. Subsequently, he announced his retirement from international cricket.Born in Dublin, Morgan made his international debut for Ireland in an ODI against Scotland in the year 2006. It was quite a memorable first match for him as he scored over 90 runs and was named the Player of the Match with his side winning the match by 85 runs. In the year 2009, Morgan made a switch to the England side and he went on to represent them for the next 13 years.In 2014, he was appointed the full-time skipper of England’s white-ball teams ahead of the 2015 World Cup. Having suffered an embarrassment in that marquee tournament, where the team didn’t even qualify for the quarter-finals, he then revolutionized the side completely with his leadership. Post that World Cup, the team played an entertaining and high-scoring ODI series against New Zealand at home, and that was the turning point for England’s drastic change in the limited-overs setup.
