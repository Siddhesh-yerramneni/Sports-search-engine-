Follow us onStar Indian all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja has been one of the mainstays of the Indian team ever since making his Test debut in 2012.

His partnership with veteran offie Ravichandran Ashwin has surged India to numerous victories in Test cricket. However, the southpaw has elevated his game to the next level in the shorter formats of the game in the recent past, becoming an integral part of the Indian white-ball setup.The Southpaw's recent absence due to an unfortunate injury has cost India dearly as the Men in Blue have struggled to replace the effervescent cricketer, leading to a disappointing T20 World Cup campaign in Australia.1.
