Warriors are languishing at bottom of the points table with a single victory in six league matches. In their last outing, they could not chase down the total of 107 in 16 overs and have a scope for improvement. Shimron Hetmyer will be a key player for the Warriors as he is the leading run-scorer for the team.On the other hand, Tallawahs are at the third position in the table with four victories in eight league matches. In their last game, the Rovman Powell-led side could score only 116 runs, and then failed to defend it as well. The likes of Fabian Allen and Raymon Reifer have turned out to be the reliable run-scorers, while Mohammad Amir and Imad Wasim are the consistent wicket-takers. Match InformationCaribbean Premier League, 21 Sep 2022, Wed, 4:30 AM IST,  ProvidenceProbable Playing XIGuyana Amazon WarriorsJermaine Blackwood, Chandrapaul Hemraj, Shimron Hetmyer(C), Junior Sinclair, PR Stirling, Keemo Paul, Romario Shepherd, Shakib Al Hasan, Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Imran Tahir, Odean SmithBench : RR Beaton, Shai Hope, CA Ingram, H Klaasen, G Moti-Kanhai, Matthew Nandu, V Permaul, T ShamsiJamaica TallawahsRovman Powell(C), Brandon King, Shamarh Brooks, Nicholson Gordon, Fabian Allen, IM Wasim, M Pretorius, Raymon Reifer, Amir Jangoo, Chris Green, Mohammad AmirBench : Jamie Merchant, Joshua James, Sandeep Lamichhane, K Lewis, Kirk McKenzie, SK Springer, Ashmead Nedd, A MansinghInjury and availability newsWeather ReportWin PredictionPitch ConditionAvg 1st Inning ScorePitch ReportPlayer PicksImad Wasim JMT |  ALLThe talented all-rounder has been terrific with his consistency in both departments.
