Follow us onAustralian batter Steve Smith wasn’t happy with the offer deal from Sydney Sixers for the upcoming season. While David Warner bagged a lucrative deal from the Sydney Thunder, not all local players were able to get a contract of the same price during the recent overseas player’s draft. The reason behind Warner being an exception is his presence which has a massive impact on crowds coming in numbers. Despite Smith having a fan following of his own, Cricket Australia hasn’t provided him with a multi-million dollar contract. Warner, meanwhile, is expected to secure an AUD340,000 deal from his franchise which is in fact, par with the overseas marquee signings. Smith mentioned the importance of local players getting the backing from their franchise in a big tournament like BBL. He noted about some local quality players not getting a big deal in terms of cash and felt that it is important for them to satisfy their needs. “In terms of tournaments around the world, you have to look after your local players most importantly," Smith was quoted as saying by The Age in Townsville ahead of the second One-day International against Zimbabwe on Wednesday.“Seeing some of the players who are coming out for big cash, I know a few of the local players that are big players are a little bit disappointed in terms of remuneration for the tournament, so I think there’s going to have to be a way around that to keep your local players happy," he added.Smith recently expressed his desire to get a big role in the T20I setup for Australia and felt that he has a lot to offer in the upcoming T20 World Cup. With Mitchell Marsh’s recent injury, Smith might just get the nod for the ICC tournament in Australia.© 2013 - 2022 CricTracker Pvt Ltd All rights reserved.
