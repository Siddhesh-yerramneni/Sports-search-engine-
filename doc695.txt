Follow us onPreviewNew Zealand will be up against the challenge of India in the second fixture of the T20I series at Bay Oval, Mount Maunganui. The first game of the series was abandoned due to rain. The T20 World Cup 2022 witnessed New Zealand topping their group points table, but falling short against Pakistan in the semi-finals. They would be missing the services of their experienced campaigners Trent Boult and Martin Guptill. As a result, the hosts would look to find contributions from Glenn Phillips and Tim Southee.India, on the other hand, were at the pole position in Group 2 of the T20 World Cup. Unfortunately, they were humbled by the English batters who run rampant to crush them in the semis. With the absence of Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, and KL Rahul, the onus will be on Hardik Pandya and Ishan Kishan to provide much-needed flourish to the team.Match InformationIndia tour of New Zealand, 20 Nov 2022, Sun, 12:00 PM IST,  Mount MaunganuiProbable Playing XINew ZealandDevon Conway, Finn Allen, Kane Williamson(C), DJ Mitchell, Mitchell Santner, James Neesham, Glenn Phillips, Tim Southee, LH Ferguson, AF Milne, Ish SodhiBench : Michael Bracewell, BM TicknerIndiaHH Pandya(C), Shubman Gill, SA Yadav, S Iyer, Deepak Hooda, Rishabh Pant, Ishan Kishan, Yuzvendra Chahal, HV Patel, Arshdeep Singh, B KumarBench : SV Samson, Washington Sundar, KL Yadav, Mohammed Siraj, Umran Malik, Shikhar Dhawan, Shardul Thakur, DL Chahar, Shahbaz Ahmed, KR SenInjury and availability newsWeather ReportWin PredictionPitch ConditionAvg 1st Inning ScorePitch ReportPlayer PicksSuryakumar Yadav IND |  BATThe skillful batter, Suryakumar Yadav has been sensational with his performances in 2022.
