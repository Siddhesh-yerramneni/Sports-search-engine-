Follow us onLegendary cricketer and former World Cup winner Sachin Tendulkar hailed team India pacer Arshdeep Singh ahead of the T20 World Cup 2022. Arshdeep built his reputation in the Indian Premier League prior to earning a debut in T20I format with the national side.Moreover, the left-arm pacer has surged in stature in recent months that has instilled confidence in the management to pick him the death bowling partner of the likes of seniors Jasprit Bumrah, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Mohammed Shami. India won their first warm up match down under against hosts Australia in a neck-to-neck contest on Monday, October 17. Somer final-over brilliance by Shami helped India seal the deal, leaving the Aussies stunned with a narrow loss. However, the young Arshdeep had a day to forget after getting battered for 34 runs in three overs with an economy of 11.33 and a wicket under his belt.Despite this, India will continue to rely on the young pace spearhead and legendary cricketer Tendulkar believes the pacer is very "committed", which is critical in T20 cricket."Arshdeep has shown a lot of promise and he looks a balanced guy. And whatever I have seen of him, he looks a committed fellow because you can see a player, you can make out looking at his mindset," Tendulkar told reporters."What I really like is that if Arshdeep has a plan, he commits to it and that is really, really important in this format as batters are going out and playing those extra shots and some innovative ones. So, if you have a plan, commit to it," he added.The exciting young talent will look to fire on all cylinders and get accustomed to the Australian conditions before heading into the much-awaited clash against Babar Azam’s Pakistan on October 23 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. © 2013 - 2022 CricTracker Pvt Ltd All rights reserved.
