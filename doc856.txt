Follow us onThe Rohit Sharma-led team India suffered a loss at the hands of hosts Bangladesh in the first of the three-match ODI series at the Sher-E-Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Dhaka on Sunday, December 4. Though the Men in Blue narrowly lost the contest by a wicket, there were certain aspects of the game which Rohit Sharma and co. could not ace and it cost them the match.While defending an underwhelming total of 186, India did try to put up a fight and gave the rival side a run for their money. However, it was Mehidy Hasan’s defiance till the very end of the contest that handed the side a massive win in the first contest. Team India needs to get back to the drawing board following the loss and might go for some tactical changes ahead of the second 50-over contest.Debutant Kuldeep Sen became the 250th player to represent India in ODIs as he donned the Men in Blue outfit against the Bangla Tigers in the first ODI match. All eyes were on the youngster, Kuldeep had a decent start to his international career as he bagged two wickets in his five overs at an economy rate of 7.40.Despite that, the Men in Blue could look to include Umran Malik, into the mix. Now, it must be noted that Umran had relished a decent outing in the recently concluded New Zealand ODI series. The pacer, who is known to consistently clock 150 kmph, scalped two wickets in the first ODI match against the Kiwis and gave 66 runs in his stipulated ten overs.What seemed impressive was Umran’s improved understanding of the game as he was not only using sheer pace but was also readjusting his line and lengths to outfox the rival batters. His inclusion might assist India as he adds extra venom to the attack.© 2013 - 2022 CricTracker Pvt Ltd All rights reserved.
