Follow us onBangladesh and Afghanistan will be playing the third match of the Asia Cup 2022 on Tuesday (August 30) at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium, Sharjah. Bangladesh have finished as the runner-up in the last two editions of the tournament and will be hoping for nothing less than a victory this year. Bangladesh have a new captain in the form of Shakib Al Hasan. Shakib’s last captaincy stint ended in September 2019 against Afghanistan and he will be resuming the work against the same opponent. In T20Is, Shakib has the lowest win percentage among the captains who have captained the side for over 20 T20Is. This was the reason he was sacked last time and he will be hoping to improve this particular record this time. Afghanistan, on the other hand, had a great start to the tournament against Sri Lanka in the first match. The players delivered an all-round performance and made it a one-sided affair. Afghanistani bowlers did a phenomenal job as they restricted Sri Lanka for just 105 runs in 19.4 overs. This happened despite Rashid Khan going wicket-less in the match. The Afghani batters chased down this mere total in just 10.1 overs. It will not be an easy task for Bangladesh to overpower Afghanistan in this game.Venue: Sharjah Cricket Stadium, SharjahDate & Time: 30th August at 7:30 PM IST and 6:00 PM Local TimeLive Streaming: Star Sports NetworkThe average first innings score at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium in the last 5 T20 matches is 169 runs. The batters are likely to find it easy to score runs here and spinners might play a key role in the second half of the match.(will be added when there is an update)Mohammad Naim, Anamul Haque (wk), Shakib Al Hasan (c), Afif Hossain, Mahmudullah, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mosaddek Hossain, Mehidy Hasan Miraz, Mohammad Saifuddin, Nasum Ahmed, Mustafizur RahmanHazratullah Zazai, Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Ibrahim Zadran, Karim Janat, Najibullah Zadran, Mohammad Nabi (c), Rashid Khan, Azmatullah Omarzai, Naveen-ul-Haq, Mujeeb Ur Rahman, Fazalhaq FarooqiHe scored 37 runs off just 28 deliveries and added 83 runs for the first wicket along with Rahmanullah Gurbaz in the first game. This year, Zazai has made 242 runs in 9 matches at an average of 34.57 and a strike rate of 134.44. His only half-century in T20Is this year came against Bangladesh only in March and Afghanistan will be hoping for a similar performance from him in this game.He has been in great form recently and is the vice-captain of the team for this tournament. Since 2021, Hossain has made 585 runs in 35 T20Is at an average of 21.66 and a strike rate of 117.46. This year, he has scored runs at an average of 32.5, which is his highest average in a year since making his debut. He scored 85 not-out in the last ODI game against Zimbabwe and won the Player of the Match award as well.The year 2021 was the best for Shakib Al Hasan in T20Is. With the ball, he picked 25 wickets in 18 matches, averaging 16.88. This was the first time that Shakib picked over 20 wickets in a year since his debut in 2006. With the bat, he scored 327 runs at an average of 19.23, this was the first time he scored over 300 runs since his debut. He has not been able to achieve such numbers in T20Is this year and the team will be hoping that he gets in the same groove considering there is a World Cup in front of them.He picked 2 wickets for 14 runs in 4 overs in the first game which is his best bowling figure since 2018. He is batting in the lower middle order and due to the presence of some in-form players at the top of the order, he might not get a chance to bat. Hence, he can only contribute to the team with the ball. We might witness another match-defining bowling performance from ‘The President’.His economy this year has been 6 in 11 matches, however, he has not been able to pick wickets regularly. In 4 out of 11 matches this year, he has gone wicket-less. Also, he has not picked more than 2 wickets in a game this year. However, he might be able to deliver a great performance in this game because the pitch is likely to offer a decent amount of support to the spinners. Also, he is one of the most successful bowlers at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium. He has taken 10 wickets in 5 matches at an average of 10.1, an economy of 5.5, and a strike rate of 11.He has also enjoyed playing at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium. His best bowling performance in T20Is has come at this venue only. In a game against Scotland in the T20 World Cup last year, Mujeeb picked 5 wickets for just 20 runs. This is also the second-best bowling figure at this venue. He picked 2 wickets for just 24 runs in the last game against Sri Lanka.He scored 40 runs off just 18 deliveries in the last game against Sri Lanka which helped Afghanistan earn a victory by a margin of 8 wickets. In 10 matches this year, Gurbaz has scored 185 runs at an average of 18.5 and a strike rate of 130.28.Anamul Haque, Rahmanullah Gurbaz (C), Sabbir Rahman, Hazratullah Zazai (VC), Afif Hossain, Shakib Al Hasan, Mohammad Nabi, Azmatullah Omarzai, Rashid Khan, Mujeeb-ur-Rahman, Mehidy Hasan MirazRahmanullah Gurbaz, Mahmudullah, Najibullah Zadran, Hazratullah Zazai, Afif Hossain, Shakib Al Hasan, Mohammad Nabi, Mustafizur Rahman, Rashid Khan (C), Naveen-ul-Haq, Mujeeb-ur-Rahman (VC)He scored half-centuries in 2 out of 3 ODIs against Zimbabwe this month. However, he has not enjoyed the same success in T20Is. In 19 T20Is, Haque has scored 440 runs at an average of 25.88 and a strike rate of 115.48. Before playing 6 T20Is this year, he last featured for Bangladesh in this format back in 2015. He might not be the right captaincy pick for your fantasy team for this match.He opened the bowling for Afghanistan in the first game and dismissed Pathum Nissanka on the fifth delivery of the match. This was his only wicket in the game as he bowled 3 overs and gave away 23 runs. In 6 matches this year, Naveen has picked 8 wickets at an average of 18.He made his T20I debut against Bangladesh this year in March. He picked 5 wickets in his first two matches and even won the Player of the Match award in only the second T20I game of his career. However, he has not been the same since then and has picked only a single wicket in the last 9 matches.© 2013 - 2022 CricTracker Pvt Ltd All rights reserved.
