He expects to play well in domestic cricket and once again get a call in the Pakistan squad.“I will work hard in the ongoing domestic season and earn my place back in the national team,” Hasan said last month. The seamer has also signed a contract with Warwickshire for the upcoming County Championship and will be available for the first four months of the season.“I'm delighted to sign for Warwickshire as they are an ambitious club and Edgbaston is a ground I've always enjoyed playing at. I hope I can help the team with my experience and contribute to some wins - maybe even a trophy,” the cricketer said after signing for the club.© 2013 - 2022 CricTracker Pvt Ltd All rights reserved.
