Follow us onThe Indian team led by Rohit Sharma were under the pump in the first ODI in Dhaka after an embarrassing batting collapse saw their innings fizzle out for just 186 runs. However, former Indian skipper Virat Kohli handed his side a lifeline by dismissing the mercurial Bangladeshi all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan, grabbing a phenomenal catch.Bangladesh's chase got off to an atrocious start after Deepak Chahar got rid of Najmul Hossain Shanto on the very first delivery of the second innings. Anamul Haque was next to make his long way back to the dugout in the tenth over of the chase. That is when the experienced pair of Litton Das and Shakib Al Hasan joined hands to keep the visitors at bay in the series opener.Although the Bangladeshi skipper fell in the 20th over, Shakib's assured presence at the crease troubled the Indian bowlers. But the southpaw was deceived in flight by Washington Sundar and mistimed his cover drive to give Kohli a chance in the short cover region. The athletic Indian star needed no second invitation, flying to his right and plucking the ball out of thin air to complete a stunning one-handed catch. The batting ace had a wry smile on his face after completing a sensational grab.Brilliant by #ViratKohli ðŸ¦…#INDvsBAN #BANvIND #CricketTwitter pic.twitter.com/LLfKEBUfq5

Kohli himself was dismissed in a similar fashion during India's batting innings when Litton Das dove full length to complete a remarkable grab. The veteran all-rounder's wicket reinvigorated the Indian bowlers, who were defending a smallish total on a surface that wasn't easy to bat. Sundar kept things tight at his end and put pressure on the hosts, but his spin bowling partner Shahbaz Ahmed kept leaking boundaries every now and then to release the pressure.Â© 2013 - 2022 CricTracker Pvt Ltd All rights reserved.
