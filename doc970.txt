Follow us onThe IPL 2023 mini-auction is just few weeks away from taking place in Kochi on December 23 and the franchises have been doing their calculations in terms of who to buy and the prices. On Thursday (December 1), as many as 991 players registered their names for the auction which includes 714 Indian players and 277 overseas players. The final set of players who will go under the hammer will be shortlisted from the overall number with the interest among the franchises.  Sunrisers Hyderabad will enter the auction with the highest purse amount and all eyes will be on them while teams like Kolkata Knight Riders will have a tough time in filling up their squads. A lot of teams have been looking out for all-rounders who are expected to go for the big money, and the likes of Ben Stokes, Cameron Green and Sam Curran have registered in the INR 2 Crore base price bracket. According to ESPNCricinfo, no Indian player has registered with a base price of INR 1.5 Crore and Shakib Al Hasan will definitely be among the top names in the bracket. The Bangladesh all-rounder has been part of the IPL for a long time now and has enough experience of 71 games to find a buyer. Harry Brook is another name to watch out for in the bracket, and the England international has been in sensational form especially in the shorter format.  Former RCB spinner Adam Zampa has registered his name while Australian quicks Sean Abbott, Riley Meredith and Jhye Richardson dominate the fast-bowling department in the INR 1.5 Crore bracket.  Players registered with base price of 1.5 Crore for IPL 2023 auction: Sean Abbott, Riley Meredith, Jhye Richardson, Adam Zampa, Shakib Al Hasan, Harry Brook, Will Jacks, Dawid Malan, Jason Roy, Sherfane Rutherford © 2013 - 2022 CricTracker Pvt Ltd All rights reserved.
