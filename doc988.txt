It was one of the most gruesome attacks in history. It has been 14 years since the cowardly terror attack rocked India, but there are many from the families of the martyrs who are still suffering. 166 people were killed and more than 300 suffered injuries in the attack carried out by ten members of Lashkar-e-Taiba, a militant terrorist organization which operated from Pakistan.The first event of the attack occurred at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus on the evening of November 26, when two gunmen open fired. The attack took place at eight different locations in Mumbai and lasted for more than three days. On November 29, 2008, in the early hours of the morning, India's National Security Guards (NSG) besieged the renowned Taj Hotel and put an end to the attacks by taking down the remaining perpetrators.The aftermath of the attack was unimaginable as it took months to get everything back to normal. 14 years down the line, people have not forgotten the heroes, who kept the hundreds of innocent lives ahead of theirs. They sacrificed their life for the nation and thus, one can never forget that day.Former and current Indian cricketers remembered the martyrs who lost their lives and paid their tributes to the brave servicemen, who still remain to be the reason behind why the survivors are called 'survivors'.Mumbai-born former India captain Sachin Tendulkar said that his prayers and thoughts are with the families of everyone who have been impacted due to the 26/11 attacks. "26/11 - We remember the innocent lives lost. We remember the courage shown by our forces. Prayers and thoughts with families of everyone who has been impacted," Tendulkar wrote in his Tweet on Saturday.

The sacrifice of all the brave men who laid down their lives protecting the country shall never be forgotten.
