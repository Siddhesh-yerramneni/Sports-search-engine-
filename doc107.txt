Follow us onPreviewPakistan and England will play the fourth T20I of the ongoing series on Sunday (September 25) at the National Stadium, Karachi. The series has moved like a pendulum swing with England winning the opening game, Pakistan equalling the series in the next game, and England again overshadowing the Pakistan team in the third match. Pakistan will hope that the pendulum will again shift to their side in this game.England made a few changes to their playing 11 in the last game to manage workload. However, they might persist with this team as both batters and bowlers had a terrific outing in the last game. Pakistan, on the other hand, might also go ahead with the same playing 11 in this game.Match InformationEngland tour of Pakistan, 25 Sep 2022, Sun, 8:00 PM IST,  KarachiProbable Playing XIPakistanBabar Azam(C), Khushdil Shah, Shan Masood, Haider Ali, Mohammad Nawaz, Iftikhar Ahmed, Mohammad Rizwan, Haris Rauf, Shahnawaz Dahani, Usman Qadir, M HasnainBench : Mohammad Haris, Asif Ali, SH Khan, Aamer Jamal, Naseem Shah, Mohammad Wasim, Abrar AhmedEnglandHC Brook, WG Jacks, DJ Malan, MM Ali(C), SM Curran, LA Dawson, BM Duckett, PD Salt, AU Rashid, RJW Topley, Mark WoodBench : Jos Buttler, Jordan Cox, RJ Gleeson, TG Helm, OP Stone, DJ Willey, Chris Woakes, L Wood, AD HalesInjury and availability newsWeather ReportWin PredictionPitch ConditionAvg 1st Inning ScorePitch ReportPlayer PicksBen Duckett ENG |  WKHe made his T20I debut against Pakistan back in 2019 and is yet to play a game against any other opponent in this format.
