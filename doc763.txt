Follow us onA major week awaits the team of West Indies as their apex board, Cricket West Indies (CWI) is set to deliver ‘coach development’ events in association with the Jamaican Cricket Association (JCA). The event will constitute a week-long program across the country starting in the upcoming week.Former Windies skipper and current CWI Director of Cricket, Jimmy Adams will be involved in the events along with CWI Coach Development Manager, Chris Brabazon and local Coach Developers - Philip Service and Gibbs Williams.“The upcoming week is part of CWI’s strategic objective to raise coaching standards across the region through a rigorous coach education and development programme. On top of delivering the face-to-face component of the CWI Level 1 course, the specialist workshops will concentrate our efforts to address specific issues affecting our regional game,” said Jimmy Adams.“It has been a massive year for our CWI Coach Development programme with over 40 face-to-face and online courses and workshops delivered to over 730 coaches. To now be heading back to Jamaica to continue the work alongside such a high caliber line-up of presenters is very exciting and I am sure that the participants, the panel ourselves, and ultimately the local players will gain plenty from the interactions,” Brabazon added.Four workshops are to be held as part of the CWI Coach Development and will cover both ‘Spin Bowling’ and ‘Batting against Spin’ on alternate nights. Furthermore, the events will include coaching components of the CWI Competition Coaching Course (Level 1) to be held at the historic Sabina Park in Jamaica.Speaking about the current scenario of cricket in the West Indies, the team is currently on the tour of Australia for a two-match Test series and are battling it out with the Aussies in the first Test at the Perth Stadium.
