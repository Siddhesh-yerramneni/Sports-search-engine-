Follow us onThe first time India and Bangladesh battled it out on the cricket field was on October 27, 1988 in Chatttogram. It has been over 34 years since then and the two Asian sides have crossed each others' paths on numerous occasions across formats. Both cricketing nations are highly passionate about the game and the excitement of fans has known no bounds whenever the Men in Blue have locked horns with the Bangla Tigers.Though India have had the wood over the Bangla Tigers over the years, Bangladesh have grown leaps and bounds of late and have given multiple scares to the two-time ODI World champions, adding to the spice of the contest. Amid the exhilarating cricket both sides have played, fans have witnessed many players etch their names in history books.India took the stage alongside Bangladesh for the final game of the three-match T20I series in November 2019 in Nagpur. The hosts batted first and posted 174 runs on the board, courtesy of half-centuries from KL Rahul (52 runs off 35 balls) and Shreyas Iyer (66 runs off 33 balls).Defending 174, Deepak Chahar gave India an ideal start with the ball, picking up two wickets in his opening spell. However, Mohammad Naim and Mohammad Mithun led Bangladesh’s recovery and stitched a 98-run stand to put their side in a strong position. But Chahar came into the attack and broke the threatening partnership by getting rid of Mithun.Then at the fag end of the innings, the Indian swing bowler took a superb hat-trick to bundle Mahmudullah & co. for 144 runs. Chahar ended the match with an insane spell of 3.2-0-7-6. With such an exceptional bowling effort, he registered India’s best figures in T20Is, surpassing Yuzvendra Chahal's phenomenal six-wicket haul against England in February 2017.When India faced the Three Lions in the final match of the T20I series, Chahal wreaked havoc with the ball, bagging six wickets for mere 25 runs to help his team win the game by 75 runs.© 2013 - 2022 CricTracker Pvt Ltd All rights reserved.
