Follow us onBen Stokes' England defeated Pakistan in a thrilling finale to draw first blood in the Test series. The visitors forced a result on one of the flattest pitches in the country after a brave declaration by their mercurial skipper on the fourth Day. The hosts were on course for a memorable victory only for an incredible last half an hour from the English bowlers to pull through in a see-saw battle in Rawalpindi.The final day started with jubilation for the England team as they got rid of the well-set Imam-ul-Haq early in the morning session. However, the hosts frustrated the English bowlers after that early setback with an 87-run stand between Saud Shakeel and Mohammad Rizwan. But the latter poked at a harmless delivery down the leg side to hand the visitors the initiative just after the Lunch break.Saud Shakeel, the 27-year-old debutant, showed tremendous application and willpower against a relentless bowling unit that threw pretty much everything at him. But just like his senior partner, Rizwan, he was trapped in England's ploy of bowling wide deliveries. England were in the ascendency but Pakistan hit back with another dogged stand between Azhar Ali and Agha Salman.Ben Stokes tried his level best to break the partnership, even bowling himself for an astonishing 11 overs on the trot from one end, only to return empty-handed as Pakistan headed into the final session with a memorable win in sight. But like the earlier two sessions, England got the breakthrough just after the break as Ollie Robinson used the reverse swinging ball to great effect, getting rid of both the set batters in the space of three overs to dent Pakistani hopes.With the win out of the equation, the hosts went into defense mode. But their resistance was short-lived as the veteran English pacer James Anderson scalped two wickets in one over to drag the visitors on the brink of a historic victory. Both Anderson and Robinson displayed great control and ability with the old ball that was reversing extravagantly on a flat Rawalpindi track and were rewarded with four wickets each. But the drama wasn't done there as the floodlights came on, handing the hosts a much-needed lifeline. Pakistan needed to survive just half an hour, while England needed just one wicket as the match turned into a cat-and-mouse game. But England's left-arm spinner Jack Leach, who was ineffective for much of the second innings, came up with the killer blow, trapping Naseem Shah plumb in front of the stumps, handing England a thrilling victory by 74 runs in the series opener.That’s such a cool win. #PakvsEng2022

Amazing performance by England! It was their sheer self belief and all out aggressive strategy that won them the match. Big credit to Stokes and McCullum. Pakistan have a lot of thinking to do!

That is one of the great wins for @englandcricket! Stokesy’s captaincy has phenomenal!! What a team to watch play!! #PAKvENG 🔥

McCullum/Stokes changing the way test cricket is to be played. Courageous, fearless positive mindset gets them a win in Rawalpindi on the most docile surface. I don’t think any other team in world cricket would have rolled the dice like that.Bring on the Ashes next year.👏👏

Incredible display of positive attitude gave England this win against Pakistan 👏 #ENGvPAK

One of the GREAT test wins .. I don’t know of any Captain in the history of Test cricket that would have got his team to Bat like his team did and then declare when he did .. unbelievable .. #PAKvENG

England showing how to play in Pakistan. Take the game by the scruff of the neck with aggressive batting and declarations. #PAKvENG #Cricket

Wow…wow…wow. Well played, England. A victory of not just the skills but also, the intent to win. Even if it’s at the cost of losing. Whatever mind can conceive…it can achieve. Test Cricket is ❤️ #PakvEng

This pitch produced a result only cos Eng made 650 in 100 overs and declared potentially risking a loss. Well played England, well led @benstokes38 @englandcricket 👏🏽 #PAKvENG pic.twitter.com/pWbAH7vhWh

Test match cricket ❤️

Shout out to @OPope32 btw. How impressive has he been as a stand in keeper. Scored a 💯, kept for ages 1st innings & been leaping like a salmon down the leg side to snaffle a few catches. What a guy 🧤

What a test match!!!! 🙏🏼👏🏼

How good is test cricket? 🙌

Wonder if Dean Elgar still thinks England are 'disrespecting' Test cricket??
