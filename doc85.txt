Follow us onLast month, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) introduced the first-ever Pakistan Junior League (PJL) with the intention of nurturing young talents at grassroot level. The same was confirmed by the Chairman of the national cricket board Ramiz Raja as he explained how it would go a long way in the well-being of the untapped talents.It has been reported that some of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) franchises are not convinced with PJL and they have reportedly threatened to protest against the same. Meanwhile, three franchises have come forward expressing their interest in buying teams in Pakistan Junior League. As per reports, the PSL franchises who are against the new programme PJL fear that it might affect that brand going forward.“We are definitely not happy with the PJL. The reason for submitting an expression of interest is that we do not want other parties to come and buy teams as it can affect us in future. Before PJL, a private league took away two of our sponsors and it could happen again”, said a PSL team official while speaking to Cricket Pakistan.“The fact is that the submission of interest does not mean that we are necessarily buying a team, we just wanted to be part of the race,” he added.Earlier this week, the PCB announced that the inaugural edition of the PJL will be hosted in Lahore from October 1 to 15 that will be featuring six teams. However, with the PSL franchises concerned about their brand value and sponsorships, it remains to be seen how the tournament will be conducted smoothly.While coming up with this new programme for the betterment of the budding cricketers in the neighboring country, the Pakistan Cricket Board had also made announcements in its press release urging for sponsorship requests for multiple tournament rights that include the title sponsorship, live-streaming, category sponsorships, team franchises, etc.© 2013 - 2022 CricTracker Pvt Ltd All rights reserved.
