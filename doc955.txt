Follow us onThe mini-auction for IPL 2023 is scheduled to take place on December 23 in Kochi, and Hugh Edmeades is all set to return as the auctioneer. The IPL auction has been hosted by Edmeades since he succeeded the previous host Richard Madley in 2018. He collapsed due to postural hypotension on the first day of the IPL 2022 mega auction which was held in February 2022.The auction had to be halted after the unfortunate incident and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) office-bearers asked Charu Sharma to step in for Edmeades while the medical team attended to him. Members of all the franchises and the BCCI officials applauded loudly and gave Edmeades a standing ovation when he returned to lead the auction's final phase.There were doubts, nevertheless, as to whether the Board would appoint him again to conduct the auction. However, Edmeades stated on Tuesday that he will be leading the auction for the upcoming season of the cash-rich event and will travel to Kochi via Dubai on December 21.“I am thrilled to have been asked by the BCCI to conduct the 2023 IPL auction and am excited about visiting Kochi for the first time,” Edmeades told  Sportstar.Before going independent in 2016, Edmeades, an independent fine art, classic car, and charity auctioneer, spent 38 years working with the renowned Christie's. Even after an experience of conducting more than 2500 auctions globally, Edmeades experienced something entirely new when he visited Jaipur in December 2018 for the IPL auction, his first term with Indian cricket.After the completion of the IPL 2022 mega auctions in February, Edmeades said it was "stupid" of him to miss meals, which may have been one of the reasons for his low blood pressure. Putting the past behind, the seasoned auctioneer, however, is anticipating an "exciting" auction in Kochi with 10 franchisees going all in to make some wise purchases.© 2013 - 2022 CricTracker Pvt Ltd All rights reserved.
