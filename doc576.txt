Oh, my goodness. Here we go. Oh, that has got to be out surely. I mean leg stump, but not missing leg surely. No Bat. Oh Jack (Leach), he’s got his glasses on. Are they steaming up? It’s like extracting teeth, come on! Come on, technology. Here We go! Yes,” Fry’s live reaction of the last over was recorded by the MCC.“Oh, Glory! What a piece of captaincy the declaration was. Oh, Ben Stokes! Stunning Captaincy! Wow, go Ben. That is exquisite. I don’t think any other captain in cricket would have won that Test match,” President Fry hailed Stokes’ captaincy.Winning the toss, skipper Ben Stokes opted to bat first as the Three Lions registered 657 runs in their first innings with over 500 runs recorded on the first day. In response, the Men in Green began their fight well with a score of 579 runs on the board.In the following innings, the Three Lions declared at 264 for 7, setting a 343-run target for Pakistan. In their chase on the final day, Pakistan eventually bundled out on the much-criticised Rawalpindi pitch thereby handing the lead to the English side. Pakistan will now look to get level in the series as they play the second Test match on December 9 at the Multan Cricket Stadium.© 2013 - 2022 CricTracker Pvt Ltd All rights reserved.
