Follow us onThe preparations for the 16th edition of the Indian Premier League have been in full swing. The IPL 2023 auction is all set to be held on December 23 in Kochi. Ahead of the marquee event, 991 players (714 Indian and 277 overseas) have thrown in their names (along with their respective base prices) to go under the hammer. BCCI will trim down the submitted player list based on input from the franchises.Many top-drawer cricketers have registered themselves for the marquee event. However, there are certain T20 stars who have kept their base prices too high and therefore, are at risk of going unsold at the forthcoming player auction.Jamie Overton is one of the promising bowling all-rounders in the England domestic circuit. The tall and lanky pacer has featured in 88 first-class games and bagged 221 wickets at an average of 30.72. On the batting front, he has scored 2112 runs at an average of 21.33.However, the 28-year-old has not been quite impressive in the shortest format. Though Overton has fared well with the bat, smashing 563 runs in 83 games at a strike rate of 173.23, he has been quite mediocre with the ball bagging 67 scalps at an alarming rate of 9.37.As Overton’s performances in the T20s are not up to the mark, it is quite tough for him to find a bidder at the upcoming player auction and given the Devon-born has kept his base price INR 2 crore, it makes his chances of featuring in IPL even bleaker.Moreover, Overton has played just one international game so far and so he does not have much experience playing on the bigger stages. Thus, one can witness the England all-rounder going unsold at the upcoming auction.© 2013 - 2022 CricTracker Pvt Ltd All rights reserved.
