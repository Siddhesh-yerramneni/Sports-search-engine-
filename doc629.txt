Ollie Pope followed suit after playing a brisk cameo. Even after losing two quick wickets, England's batting ace Joe Root along with Zak Crawley kept their foot on the accelerator and found boundaries frequently.Root, who missed out on a century in the first innings, while four of the other top five English batters registered their respective tons, turned left-handed in an attempt to tackle Zahid Mahmood.

Former England skipper Nasser Hussain was amazed by Root's ability to bat left-handed while on commentary duties. Mahmood's persistence with the leg-stump line paid dividends as Root eventually fell prey to the ploy on a personal score of 73 runs, missing out on a well-deserved century. His dismissal brought in the English skipper Ben Stokes to the crease, who could not contribute to England's total and was dismissed by Mahmood for a three-ball-duck.However, Harry Brook stands in the way of the Pakistani bowlers, stretching England's lead over the 300-run mark. With nearly 40 overs left in the day, the visitors will be hoping to set Pakistan a total of more than 500 runs, given their exploits with the bat in the first innings.Â© 2013 - 2022 CricTracker Pvt Ltd All rights reserved.
