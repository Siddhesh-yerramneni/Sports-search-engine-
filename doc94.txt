Follow us onSri Lanka player Wanindu Hasaranga has been handed an official reprimand for breaching Level 1 of the ICC Code of Conduct during the third ODI of the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup Super League series against Afghanistan in Pallekele on Wednesday.Hasaranga was found to have breached Article 2.8 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel which relates to “showing dissent at an Umpire’s decision during an International Match.”In addition to this, one demerit point has been added to Hasaranga’s disciplinary record, for whom it was the first offence in a 24-month period.The incident occurred in the 26th over of Afghanistan’s innings. Hasaranga showed his displeasure by pointing to the giant screen when the TV umpire overturned a leg-before decision on review after batter Najibullah Zadran had initially been given out.Hasaranga admitted the offence and accepted the sanction proposed by Ranjan Madugalle of the Emirates ICC Elite Panel of Match Referees, so there was no need for a formal hearing.On-field umpires Nitin Menon and Lyndon Hannibal, third umpire Raveendra Wimalasari and fourth umpire Ruchira Palliyaguruge levelled the charge.When a player accumulates four or more demerit points in a two-year period, they are modified into suspension points and the player is banned. Two suspension points equate to a ban from one Test, two ODIs, or two T20Is, whichever emerges first for the individual.Level 1 breaches result in a minimum of an official reprimand, a maximum penalty of 50% of a player's match fee, and one or two demerit points. Demerit Points will be kept on a player's or player support personnel's disciplinary record for twenty-four months after they are imposed, after which they will be removed.Sri Lanka put in an astounding effort to chase down a target of 314, which Afghanistan set after a batting masterclass by Ibrahim Zadran. They evened the series at 1-1 and moved up to ninth in the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup Super League.© 2013 - 2022 CricTracker Pvt Ltd All rights reserved.
