Follow us onPreviewPakistan will be up against the challenge of Bangladesh in Match 41 of the T20 World Cup 2022 on Sunday at Adelaide Oval. Both teams have four points under their kitty and would look to win this game and stake a claim for the semis spot if South Africa loses their last game. In their last outing, Pakistan managed to win by 33 runs against South Africa and will look to continue the same momentum. The likes of Iftikhar Ahmed and Shadab Khan have been impressive for them. Bangladesh, on the other hand, delivered spirited performances in their last fixture against India but fell short by five runs. The experienced players Litton Das and Taskin Ahmed, are expected to be the top performers for the Tigers. It will be interesting to see which side ends on a winning note. Match InformationICC Men's T20 World Cup, 6 Nov 2022, Sun, 9:30 AM IST,  AdelaideProbable Playing XIPakistanBabar Azam(C), Shan Masood, SH Khan, Iftikhar Ahmed, Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Rizwan, Mohammad Haris, Haris Rauf, Mohammad Wasim, Naseem Shah, S AfridiBench : Asif Ali, Haider Ali, Khushdil Shah, M Hasnain, Usman Qadir, Shahnawaz Dahani, FK ZamanBangladeshYasir Ali, Nazmul Hossain Shanto, Afif Hossain, M Hossain, Shakib Al Hasan(C), Liton Das, Nurul Hasan, Mustafizur Rahman, Taskin Ahmed, Hasan Mahmud, Shoriful IslamBench : Sabbir Rahman, Mehidy Hasan Miraz, M Saifuddin, Ebadot Hossain, Nasum Ahmed, Mahedi Hasan, Rishad Hossain, Soumya SarkarInjury and availability newsWeather ReportWin PredictionPitch ConditionAvg 1st Inning ScorePitch ReportPlayer PicksLiton Das BAN |  WKLitton smoked 60 off 27 balls against India in his latest outing at the same ground and will be upbeat about his abilities.
