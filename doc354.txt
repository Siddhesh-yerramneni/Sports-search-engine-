The southpaw is excited about the competition as it will provide a platform for the youngsters in the country. It is worth noting that all the participating teams are owned by IPL franchises."Pretty much it's a new tournament, so, I guess looking forward to the unexpected, we've had a couple of these tournaments, and there hasn't been one in a while. A lot of youngsters who haven't been part of the big tournament will be involved in this, so it will be good for the new guys and obviously for the guys who've been around in serving cricket. This is also new for us, so, this would be amazing another new comp, so I can't wait." "I've played with everyone, I know what I'm dealing with, and so, I know the boys are going to have a lot of fun with the children, with the fisherman as well. So I know that's what I'm dealing with, so it's pretty easy for me," de Kock said while speaking in an interview with the SA20 League.© 2013 - 2022 CricTracker Pvt Ltd All rights reserved.
