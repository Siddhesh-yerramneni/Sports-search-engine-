Follow us on2019 WC Champions England added another elusive trophy to their cabinet as Jos Buttler led his side to their second T20 WC title after beating Pakistan by five wickets in the final of the 2022 edition at the historic Melbourne Cricket Ground. England joined West Indies as the two-time 20-overs WC winners with their maiden title coming 12 years back in 2010 under the stewardship of Paul Collingwood. The English side scripted another history as they became the first team to hold both ODI and T20 WCs at the same time.The eighth edition of the marquee event took place on Australian shores. Notably, the hosts and the defending champions Australia had a tournament to forget as they failed to make it to the final four courtesy of a lesser net run rate than eventual champions England and New Zealand. Throughout the campaign down under, there were some memorable and epic matches along with individual brilliance. The Kiwis thrashing their Trans-Tasman rivals Australia in the opening fixture of the Super 12 round and the blockbuster India-Pakistan clash the following day at the ‘G’ were some noteworthy encounters.It was also a World Cup full of upsets with some associate nations pulling off shocking victories against the Big Boys. 2012 and 2016 champions West Indies suffered a major blow when they failed to enter the main draw of the tournament after losing to Scotland and Ireland in the qualifying round. Speaking about individual performances, run-machine Virat Kohli again stood tall in the T20 WC as he ended the campaign as the highest run-scorer with 296 runs. Shadab Khan, Sam Curran, and Suryakumar Yadav were some of the other players that performed consistently in the mega event.England’s Sam Curran grabbed the Player of the Tournament award as he became the first specialist bowler to achieve the feat in the history of the competition. In six innings, the left-arm medium-pacer took 13 wickets at an average of 11.38 and an economy rate of just 6.52. His best spell of 5/10 came against Afghanistan when he became the first English bowler to pick a five-for in T20Is. Notably, Curran also won the Player of the Match award in the mega final for his spell of 3/12 (4). The previous winners of this prize were Shahid Afridi (2007), Tilakaratne Dilshan (2009), Kevin Pietersen (2010), Shane Watson (2012), Virat Kohli (2014 and 2016) and David Warner (2021).Pre-tournament favorites England were the well-deserving winners of the competition as they bounced back brilliantly after a shocking defeat against Ireland by DLS.. With their next match with Afghanistan getting abandoned due to rain, Buttler and his men then registered four victories on the bounce including the summit clash with Pakistan to seal their second title. After the debacle of the 2015 World Cup, the English side has become a real force in white-ball cricket with two recent World Cups in their cabinet. Meanwhile, lets test your knowledge in this quiz based on T20 WC 2022:
