Follow us onThe defending champions Australia faced a crushing defeat against New Zealand who ended up in the last edition as the runners-up. Aussie skipper Aaron Finch won the flip of the coin and asked the Kiwis to bat first at the turf of Sydney Cricket Ground. Batting first, Kane Williamson’s men posted a massive total of 200 runs for the loss of only three wickets in the allotted 20 overs. After the hard defeat, Aaron Finch was in conversation with the media and answered a lot of questions put to him by reporters. He was asked about the failure of middle-order in the very first match of the big tournament and what he concluded from this defeat to make a note for the remaining part of the tournament.“If Warner and Finch fail to do something, how can you trust this middle order and what are your findings after today’s defeat?” asked the CricTracker reporter“Yeah, I think with the middle order being the big thing, as a top border, we've got to do our job, to be able to provide a foundation for them to, to be able to play in a way that expresses what best suits them and then they can express themselves that way,” replied Finch while speaking to a reporter on CricTracker.Later, he also talked about the impacts of top order’s failure on the middle-order as the match only succeeds with a fine run rate in consideration. The 35-year-old also admitted what went on to put a pressure on the later batting order.  "So, if we go into to the second power play, one down than I think that makes it easier because the fielders out, they can settle into the game. And if we're up on the run rate, then there's not as much pressure on them and later they had probably been leaving a little bit too much to the middle and later order," he added later.
