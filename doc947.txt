With the mini-auction on the horizon that is scheduled to be held in Kochi on December 23, all of the 10 franchises were asked to submit the final list of players retained and released before the deadline on Tuesday, November 15. Teams participating in the top-tier league made a few bold calls on releasing certain heavyweights to free up the wage bill and further utilize the resources in the auction next month.  All the sides were busy rejigging their squad making vital changes until the deadline day as 163 players were retained by the franchises whereas 85 players were released from their existing squads. Sunrisers Hyderabad have the highest remaining purse of Rs 42.25 crore heading into the auction. Three players were officially traded as the Royal Challengers Bangalore traded Jason Behrendorff to Mumbai Indians, while IPL 2022 champions Gujarat Titans traded Lockie Ferguson and Rahmanullah Gurbaz to the Kolkata Knight Riders. Few players even made headlines after being released as Kane Williamson and Mayank Agarwal, captains of SRH and Punjab Kings were both released thereby making them available for the upcoming auction. Interestingly, the duo were bagged by their respective sides for a massive 14 Cr.   In any case, as the franchises are headed for the auction next month, teams will look to use their remaining purse in a structured manner and rope in players that can add depth to the squad, helping them compete for the title.  © 2013 - 2022 CricTracker Pvt Ltd All rights reserved.
