Follow us onRohit Sharma-led team India has locked horns with Bangladesh in the first of the three-match ODI series at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. The visitors, who have been put to bat first by the Bangla Tigers, swiftly lost three wickets in under 10 overs of their batting innings.In form, Virat Kohli, who marked his return to the national side after a break he took in the recently concluded New Zealand series, was dismissed rather quickly with a terrific catch by the rival skipper, Litton Das. Veteran Bangladesh star Shakib Al Hasan struck twice as he dismissed both skipper Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli in quick time.Speaking about the ODI match against Bangladesh, the flamboyant right-hander had been gearing up massively in the lead-up to the contest. However, the batter was dismissed for just nine runs from the 15 deliveries he faced.In the fourth ball of the 11th over, Shakib took the responsibility with the ball and swiftly dismissed the swashbuckling right-hander, courtesy of Litton Dasâ€™ stunner of a catch. Kohli was left bamboozled by the catch taken by the rival skipper as were the fans. Litton who was present in the extra cover spot grabbed hold of the ball and took the one-handed stunner.Team India has found themselves in a rather tricky scenario and the onus is on the middle-order batters to take the responsibilities and help propel the side to posting a respectable total. While there are overs left for the Men in Blue to still recover, it remains if the Bangla Tigers are able to continue mounting the pressure on Rohit Sharma and Co.Kohli regained his form in the Asia Cup 2022 earlier this year after a short sabbatical he took from the sport, upon which he roared back to form and maintained it in the T20 World Cup 2022. He became the highest run-getter of the marquee event down under with 291 runs in his campaign with the national side.Aman on Twitter: "Fielders turn into superhumans when Kohli comes out to bat https://t.co/LAuxv0c7ge" / TwitterMe after Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma got out- #BANvIND #ViratKohlið“ƒµ #RohitSharma pic.twitter.com/XThplOml6N
