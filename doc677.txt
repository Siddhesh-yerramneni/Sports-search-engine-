Follow us onThe T20 World Cup 2022 came to an end as England outclassed Pakistan in the final showdown to clinch the silverware for the second time. Sam Curran (4-0-12-3) starred for the Three Lions with the ball while Ben Stokes (52* runs off 49 balls) delivered the goods with the bat.The T20 extravaganza turned out to be a tournament where the captains did not have to worry about the dew and also there was not much emphasis on the toss. Additionally, the high-profile competition saw an even contest between bat and ball. Bowlers had their say more often than not which added more spice to the tournament. Let us look at the bowling attacks of the Super 12 teams and rate them based on their performance at the marquee event:The Bangladesh bowlers started their campaign on a good note and produced an impressive bowling effort to defend a par total of 144 against the Netherlands. However, in their next game, they were clobbered all around the park by the Proteas batters and conceded 205 runs in 20 overs.When the Bangla Tigers locked horns against Zimbabwe, the bowling group held its nerves to take the team to victory in what was an exciting game. But against heavyweight nations like India and Pakistan, Shakib Al Hasan & co. were good in patches and not consistent enough in the longer duration of the game.Taskin Ahmed was the stand-out bowler for Bangladesh at the marquee tournament and picked eight wickets in five games at an economy of 7.27. On the contrary, the veteran duo of Shakib and Mustafizur Rahman was not able to perform as per expectations. Though Mustafizur gave runs at an economy of 5.60, he could take mere three wickets. Talking about the Bangladesh skipper, he bagged six wickets but conceded runs at an economy of 8.78.Â© 2013 - 2022 CricTracker Pvt Ltd All rights reserved.
