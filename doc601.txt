Follow us onPreviewAustralia will be up against the challenge of England in the first fixture of the ODI series at Adelaide Oval. Australia are coming into this series, after crashing out of the Super 12 stage, while England will be confident after a title victory in the T20 WC. However, with the change in format, the hosts would look to come up with improved performance and get their confidence back. In their last ODI series, the Aussies secured a 3-0 clean sweep against New Zealand and will aspire to replicate the same performance. On the other hand, England drew their last T20I series 1-1 against Australia. The key players for Australia will be David Warner and Adam Zampa, while England will trust the abilities of Jos Buttler and Sam Curran.Match InformationEngland tour of Australia, 17 Nov 2022, Thur, 8:50 AM IST,  AdelaideProbable Playing XIAustraliaDavid Warner, Steve Smith, MP Stoinis, TM Head, MR Marsh, C Green, AT Carey, Mitchell Starc, A Zampa, Josh Hazlewood, Pat Cummins(C)Bench : MS Wade, JP Inglis, AJ Finch, Tim David, AC Agar, DR Sams, KW Richardson, Mitchell Swepson, Nathan Ellis, Sean Abbott, GJ Maxwell, Marnus LabuschagneEnglandDJ Malan, JJ Roy, JM Vince, MM Ali, DJ Willey, SM Curran, Chris Woakes, Jos Buttler(C), PD Salt, AU Rashid, CJ JordanBench : AD Hales, LS Livingstone, HC Brook, Ben Stokes, LA Dawson, RJW Topley, Mark Wood, TS Mills, RJ Gleeson, Sam Billings, L Wood, OP StoneInjury and availability newsWeather ReportWin PredictionPitch ConditionAvg 1st Inning ScorePitch ReportPlayer PicksJos Buttler ENG |  WKButtler was the best batter for England in T20 WC 2022 with 225 runs in six outings.
