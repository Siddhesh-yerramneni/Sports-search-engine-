Follow us onAmassing a massive total in an innings in the longest format of the sport in Test cricket is arguably one of the most difficult jobs. It is so as it requires patience, perseverance, and the construction of partnerships between the players which could prove to be key for the side in the innings.There have been teams who have etched their names in history for posting massive scores in their innings and in particular, on Day 1 of the five-day test match. Some terrific moments have been displayed in the ongoing England and Pakistan clash at the Rawalpindi Stadium as the Three Lions batters quite literally put up a massive show scoring 506 runs for the loss of four wickets at the end of Day 1.There have been sides who have amassed beyond 400 runs in just Day 1 of the Test match creating record-breaking scores. However, with England now scoring 506 runs on the board essentially means that they top the list of most runs scored on Day 1 of a Test match.Australia stand second as they scored 494 runs against South Africa at home in Sydney, way back in 1910 in December. On just the first day, as they went past the 400-run mark, the side had lost six wickets in their innings as their skipper Clem Hill scored a humongous 191 runs knock that helped the side attain a big total.Australia achieved a similar feat against the same side, the Proteas in 2012, with opener David Warner constructing a beautiful knock of 119 runs. The Aussies eventually ended up scoring 482 runs on Day 1, making it the third highest score by a side on Day 1.England holds the fourth and fifth spots on the list with 475 runs and 471 runs against Ashes rivals, Australia and Asian heavyweights, team India. Both matches were played at home and interestingly, both at the Oval which occurred in 1934 and 1936.1 Dec, 20229 Dec, 1910   22 Nov, 201218 Aug, 1934   15 Aug, 1936              © 2013 - 2022 CricTracker Pvt Ltd All rights reserved.
