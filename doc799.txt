Follow us onPreviewSouth Africa will be up against the challenge of the Netherlands in Match 40 of the T20 World Cup 2022 at Adelaide Oval. It will be a must-win game for the Proteas to seal the semi-finals spot. In their last league match, South Africa could not chase a target of 142 runs in 14 overs against Pakistan and would look to come up with improved performances. The likes of Aiden Markram and Anrich Nortje will be key players.The Netherlands, on the other hand, have a single victory in four games. But they certainly hold much talent to cause an upset in this fixture and end the tournament on a positive note. In their last outing, the Netherlands chased down the target of 118 easily against Zimbabwe. The top performers have been Max O’Dowd and Paul Van Meekeren.Match InformationICC Men's T20 World Cup, 6 Nov 2022, Sun, 5:30 AM IST,  AdelaideProbable Playing XISouth AfricaT Bavuma(C), AK Markram, DA Miller, RR Rossouw, T Stubbs, WD Parnell, Q de Kock, L Ngidi, A Nortje, K Rabada, T ShamsiBench : H Klaasen, RR Hendricks, KA Maharaj, Dwaine Pretorius, AL Phehlukwayo, M Jansen, BC Fortuin, LB WilliamsNetherlandsColin Ackermann, TLW Cooper, BFW de Leede, SJ Myburgh, MP O'Dowd, RE van der Merwe, S Edwards(C), Logan van Beek, Brandon Glover, Fred Klaassen, PA van MeekerenBench : Shariz Ahmad, T van der Gugten, AT Nidamanuru, Tim Pringle, Vikramjit SinghInjury and availability newsWeather ReportWin PredictionPitch ConditionAvg 1st Inning ScorePitch ReportPlayer PicksAiden Markram SA |  BATMarkram is a quality batter in crunch moments and sets his foot on the gas to accelerate at the right time.
