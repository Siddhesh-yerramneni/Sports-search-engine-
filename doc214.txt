Follow us onIndia lost the first One Day International from a position of strength against Bangladesh defending 186 runs at the Shere Bangla National Stadium in Dhaka. The Indian team dropped catches and also there was a few misfields that eventually resulted in their one-wicket defeat.While KL Rahul dropped a sitter from Mehidy Hasan Miraz who was then batting on 15, Washington Sundar seemingly did not put in any efforts off the following delivery to make full use of a catching opportunity that could have been a decisive moment of the game.Reacting on the same, veteran wicketkeeper-batter Dinesh Karthik has wondered why Sundar did not even bother to go for that catch in the first place. At the same time Karthik also asked whether the all-rounder could not judge the ball properly or was he distracted by the lights?"Obviously KL Rahul's drop towards the end and Sundar not coming, don't know why he didn't come in. I don't know if it was because of the lights, which I wouldn't know, but if he had seen the ball, he should have gone for it. That's only a question he can answer. Overall fielding effort was 50-50. Not the best day, but not the worst day either. I guess in the end, with the pressure, we left some boundaries as well," said Karthik while speaking on Cricbuzz.Immediately after Rahul had dropped an easy catch,  India could have ended the proceedings on the very next ball itself when Mehidy Hasan mistimed one in the air and at one point in time, it appeared as if Washington Sundar would end up completing a simple catch at third-man.However, to everyone’s dismay, Sundar failed to make any attempts in going for the catch supposedly due to losing the sight of the ball in the floodlights. India skipper Rohit Sharma who had lost his composure due to Sundar’s casual approach was then seen fuming at the latter.© 2013 - 2022 CricTracker Pvt Ltd All rights reserved.
