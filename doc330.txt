Follow us onBangladesh's star allrounder Shakib Al Hasan has joined Guyana Amazon Warriors for the remainder of the 2022 Caribbean Premier League (CPL). Shakib replaces spinner Tabraiz Shamsi, who has joined the national team for the upcoming white-ball series against India. Shamsi has been the leading wicket-taker for the Warriors with eight wickets in just four matches this season.The in-form Afghan youngster Rahmanullah Gurbaz has also replaced Heinrich Klaasen at Amazon Warriors. The 20-year-old batter will be making his debut in CPL after impressive outings in the 2022 Asia Cup in the UAE. He scored 152 runs in just five matches at a strike rate of 163.44, including a match-winning 84-run knock against Sri Lanka.Shakib, 35, can add value to the Warriors due to his prior experience in the CPL. He has won the title on two occasions, with Jamaica Tallawahs in 2016 and with Barbados Royals in 2019. He also holds the record of the best bowling spell in CPL history, six for six in 2013. He has taken 122 wickets and scored over 2000 runs in T20I cricket so far and will be a great addition to Warriors' squad, who are reeling at the bottom of the table with just one win in five matches.Shamsi was always going to leave in the second half of the CPL 2022 due to national team duties. And Shakib was already in the line to replace him. Earlier, he (Shakib) had obtained the NOC from Bangladesh Cricket Board to join CPL. But now the team is set to travel to UAE to prepare for the upcoming T20 World Cup 2022 next month and Shakib might get recalled from the CPL at a later stage. The second-placed Jamaica Tallawahs have strengthened their squad by signing Afghanistan skipper Mohammad Nabi. The veteran allrounder will strengthen their spin attack as they released Nepal's Sandeep Lamichhane earlier this month. Nabi took 12 wickets in 12 matches and scored 156 runs at a strike rate of 124.80 for Saint Lucia Kings in the 2020 edition.© 2013 - 2022 CricTracker Pvt Ltd All rights reserved.
