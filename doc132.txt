But the spinner are expected to play a crucial part in the match, especially in the second innings, when the pitch dries up considerably.

The powerful opening batter would like to continue his form and topple Kyle Mayers in the run-scoring charts, who has played one more game than Charles in the tournament.Rashid Khan made an instant return with his return to the CPL by returning with exceptional bowling figures of 8/1 in his four overs in the previous encounter against the second-placed Jamaica Tallawahs. The mercurial leggie missed the initial matches due to his commitment s with the national team in the recently concluded 15th edition of the Asia Cup. He will be a handful for the batters on a slowish surface at the Brian Lara Stadium. © 2013 - 2022 CricTracker Pvt Ltd All rights reserved.
