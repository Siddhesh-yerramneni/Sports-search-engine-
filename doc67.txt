Follow us onEngland Women will be visiting the Caribbean for three One Day Internationals and five T20Is between December 4 to December 23. The ODI series is a part of the ICC Women’s Championship, and thus is of prime significance. Meanwhile, the shortest format will be a good match practice for both sides heading into the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup 2023 which is set to be hosted by South Africa.The eight white-ball matches will be played across Antigua and Barbados. England, who were blanked 0-3 at home against India a couple of months ago, would be hoping to rediscover their rhythm in the 50-over format. Meanwhile, they also have some serious concerns in the T20Is after failing to finish on the podium at the Commonwealth Games 2022 at home.England will be boosted by the return of their seasoned players Nat Sciver, Katherine Brunt, and skipper Heather Knight and they would be expected to showcase total dominance over the Caribbean side. This is also a massive opportunity for the West Indies to dominate the former world champions by banking on their home advantage. They had beaten England in a Women’s World Cup fixture earlier this year and thus, the visitors shall not underestimate the Caribbean unit at their own peril.Even in the shortest format, the Windies would look to give the visitors a run for their money as they have some world-class T20 players in their arsenal.DateMatchVenueTime (IST)December 4, 20221st ODISir Vivian Richards Stadium, Antigua11:30 PMDecember 6, 20222nd ODISir Vivian Richards Stadium, Antigua11:30 PMDecember 9, 20223rd ODISir Vivian Richards Stadium, Antigua11:30 PMDecember 11, 20221st T20ISir Vivian Richards Stadium, Antigua3:30 AM (Dec 12)December 14, 20222nd T20IKensington Oval, Barbados3:30 AM (Dec 15)December 17, 20223rd T20IKensington Oval, Barbados3:30 AM (Dec 18)December 18, 20224th T20IKensington Oval, Barbados3:30 AM (Dec 19)December 22, 20225th T20IKensington Oval, Barbados3:30 AM (Dec 23)England Squads: ODIs- Heather Knight (c), Tammy Beaumont, Lauren Bell, Alice Capsey, Kate Cross, Alice Davidson-Richards, Freya Davies, Charlie Dean, Sophia Dunkley, Sophie Ecclestone, Amy Jones, Freya Kemp, Emma Lamb, Nat Sciver, Danni WyattT20Is- Heather Knight (c), Lauren Bell, Katherine Brunt, Alice Capsey, Freya Davies, Charlie Dean, Sophia Dunkley, Sophie Ecclestone, Sarah Glenn, Amy Jones, Freya Kemp, Nat Sciver, Lauren Winfield-Hill, Issy Wong, Danni WyattWest Indies Squads:ODIs- Hayley Matthews (c), Shakera Selman (vc), Aaliyah Alleyne, Shemaine Campbelle (wk), Afy Fletcher, Cherry Ann Fraser, Shabika Gajnabi, Sheneta Grimmond, Chinelle Henry, Kycia Knight (wk), Chedean Nation, Karishma Ramharack, Kaysia Schultz, Rashada WilliamsT20Is- TBAFancode will be streaming all the games live in India.   © 2013 - 2022 CricTracker Pvt Ltd All rights reserved.
