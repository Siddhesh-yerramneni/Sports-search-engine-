Apart from making some new additions, the ‘Yellow Army’ have also taken some tough calls to remove some players after an underwhelming 2022 season where they finished at the second-last position in the points table.  It was a no-brainer that the legendary skipper MS Dhoni was going to be a sureshot retention for IPL 2023 and that he would continue as their captain for the next season as well. Star India all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja also has been retained despite rumors of him being at loggerheads with the team management.Meanwhile, Ruturaj Gaikwad who was the Orange Cap winner of CSK’s victorious 2021 season had a forgettable 2022, but despite that the franchise has backed by retaining him.The Chennai Super Kings have shown faith in bowling all-rounder Deepak Chahar by giving him one more chance to prove his mettle in the next season.
