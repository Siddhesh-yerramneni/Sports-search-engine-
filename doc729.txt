Follow us onAfter a long time, the trio of Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, and Virat Kohli featured in India's ODI squad but eventually failed to put up a show. Dhawan and Rohit are often regarded as one of the best opening combinations in modern-day ODI cricket but their recent performance has been a matter of concern.Playing in the first ODI, the openers got dismissed cheaply as Dhawan failed to execute a reverse sweep and dragged it back onto his stumps. The southpaw was dismissed for seven runs and soon after, the Indian captain Rohit lost his wicket to Shakib Al Hasan while batting at 27. The 35-year-old failed to pick Shakib’s line and length and was left disappointed after a steady start.In the same over of Rohit’s dismissal, team India lost the wicket of Virat Kohli as well. Skipper Litton Das dived full length to his right to grab a stunner and with that, India lost their entire top order. Kohli was dismissed at nine as Shakib gave Bangladesh a dream start in the first ODI.Thus, the return of the trio was short-lived and Indian fans seem utterly disappointed as they criticised the unit's performance on Twitter. New opposition, same script. #BANvIND

Once again, it comes to middle order #BANvIND

Bangladesh in ODIs are different level. One of the most settled ODI sides right now. #BANvIND

What a show. Shakib Al hasan back again. #BANvIND

ICT players have forgotten how to play ODI cricket. It's not tough as test cricket but not easy as T20 as well. Nothing new in us fans getting disappointed.#BANvIND #INDvBAN
