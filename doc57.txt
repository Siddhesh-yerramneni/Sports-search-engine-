Follow us onPreviewNew Zealand(NZ) will lock horns with India(IND) in the first fixture of the T20I series at Sky Stadium, Wellington. New Zealand topped the Group 1 points table in the T20 WC 2022 but failed to go past Pakistan in the semi-final of T20 WC 2022. They will be without the services of their key players like Trent Boult and Martin Guptill, and the onus will be on Tim Southee and Glenn Phillips. India, on the other hand, were at the pole position in Group 2, but unfortunately lost the semi-final game against England. India’s top three batters, Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul, and Virat Kohli have been rested for this series. The Men in Blue will be captained by Hardik Pandya and will rely on the contributions of Suryakumar Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal.Match InformationIndia tour of New Zealand, 18 Nov 2022, Fri, 12:00 PM IST,  WellingtonProbable Playing XINew ZealandDevon Conway, Finn Allen, Kane Williamson(C), DJ Mitchell, Mitchell Santner, James Neesham, Glenn Phillips, Tim Southee, LH Ferguson, AF Milne, Ish SodhiBench : Michael Bracewell, BM TicknerIndiaHH Pandya(C), Shubman Gill, SA Yadav, S Iyer, Deepak Hooda, Rishabh Pant, Ishan Kishan, Yuzvendra Chahal, Arshdeep Singh, HV Patel, B KumarBench : SV Samson, Washington Sundar, KL Yadav, Mohammed Siraj, Umran Malik, Shikhar Dhawan, Shardul Thakur, Shahbaz Ahmed, DL Chahar, KR SenInjury and availability newsWeather ReportWin PredictionPitch ConditionAvg 1st Inning ScorePitch ReportPlayer PicksSuryakumar Yadav IND |  BATMr. 360, Suryakumar Yadav mustered 239 runs in six outings of T20 WC 2022 at a lavish strike rate of 189.68, with three fifties, and is the best pick for this game.Glenn Phillips NZ |  WKPhillips emerged as the top batter of New Zealand in T20 World Cup 2022 with 201 runs in five innings at a strike rate of 158.26, while registering a century as well.Devon Conway NZ |  BATThe southpaw has been successful to give a stable start to the New Zealand team in T20Is.
