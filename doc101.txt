The southpaw has looked in his elements throughout the event and hence a big knock is on the cards for him.Jason Holder:The veteran all-rounder has been in terrific form with the ball in hand and has claimed 14 dismissals in the CPL this season, the second-most after Alzarri Joseph's 16 scalps. His bowling partnership with Obed McCoy has been crucial for Royals in this year's edition of the competition.Â© 2013 - 2022 CricTracker Pvt Ltd All rights reserved.
