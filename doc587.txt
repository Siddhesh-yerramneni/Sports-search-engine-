However, in a rare instance, Indian skipper Rohit Sharma’s bat was spotted with Suryakumar Yadav’s name on it during the first ODI against Bangladesh. Both the batters have shared a lot of memories together right from playing for their state team, Mumbai. Now with the 'SK Yadav' sign underneath the willow, the fans speculate if Rohit used Suryakumar’s bat.  Notably, Suryakumar isn’t part of the ongoing ODI series in Bangladesh and has been rested to manage his workload after the T20 World Cup 2022 campaign and the New Zealand tour. The Mumbaikar recently brought up his second century in T20Is against New Zealand and has been in terrific form throughout the year.Suryakumar and Rohit have different set of sponsors, and in the video, Rohit was spotted with the CEAT sticker at the bottom half of the bat. However, the sign of ‘SK Yadav’ underneath Rohit’s bat was captured in a quick moment and appeared just briefly on the screen in the fifth over of the innings.

Meanwhile, Rohit looked in exquisite touch with the bat and hit four boundaries and a six in his entertaining knock. However, his elegant stroke-making was short-lived as he was dismissed for a 31-ball 27. India suffered a major batting collapse post the dismissal of Rohit and were bundled out for just 186 in 41.2 overs. Bangladesh chased down the score with one wicket in hand on account of a heroic tenth-wicket partnership between Mehidy Hasan Miraz and Mustafizur Rahman. The second ODI is scheduled to take place on December 7 at the Sher-E-Bangla Stadium in Dhaka with the series on the line for the visitors.© 2013 - 2022 CricTracker Pvt Ltd All rights reserved.
