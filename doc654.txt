Follow us onSouth Africa pacer Kagiso Rabada has expressed his concerns over the frequency of matches being played in a year. The pace spearhead shared his thoughts just prior to leaving for the three-match Test series in Australia.The South African nation is blessed with the qualities of Rabada in terms of pace and he is among the few bowlers who has represented the side on 26 occasions (Tests, ODIs, T20Is incisive) this year. With the hectic schedule packed with matches, Rabada stated that he is ‘concerned’ with the amount of cricket played.“It is a concern with the amount of cricket that’s being played. It needs to be managed. Plans need to be made accordingly. You can feel it in the intensity of your play. It’s not where you want it to be and it catches up with you over time. Playing international cricket, you want high intensity more often than not. It’s just a challenge that needs to be me," said Rabada as quoted by The Indian Express.Apart from the 14 T20Is, seven tests, and five ODIs, Rabada was also an integral member of the Punjab Kings in the Indian Premier League (IPL) playing in 13 matches throughout the league phase this year. He further added that the year has been long in terms of matches and that one has to ‘move on’.“It’s been a long year. I’ve been lucky enough to play with Dale (Steyn), Vernon (Philander), Morne (Morkel), and Kyle Abbott; some greats of the game. You’ve got Lungi and Marco and Anrich now, who are bowling extremely well and have a good taste of international cricket. I’ve bowled in tandem with them for a decent amount of time now for us to know each other and communicate as a group. Times just have to move on,” added the pace spearhead.Rabada is part of the squad touring to Australia for the forthcoming three-match Test series starting from December 17.© 2013 - 2022 CricTracker Pvt Ltd All rights reserved.
