He was predominantly picked to address the death bowling issues. But the England bowler looked out of rhythm by taking only two wickets in four games at a miserable economy rate of 10.52. In the last edition, he couldn’t do much for CSK but his recent performance in two World Cup games against India and Pakistan could get him another IPL contract in the mini-auction. Teams such as Punjab Kings (PBKS) and Delhi Capitals (DC) could bid for him to provide strength to their bowling attack.With the ability to clock over 140 km/hr and bowl accurate yorkers and bouncers, he could rattle any batting line-up in the business, on his day. In the next auction, he could emerge as one of the marquee players to attract a good sum from franchises.© 2013 - 2022 CricTracker Pvt Ltd All rights reserved.
