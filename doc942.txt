Neesham joins the squad ahead of BBL 12 as an overseas replacement player.The hard-hitting Kiwi dasher declined a central contract from New Zealand Cricket in September in order to fulfill his commitments with global domestic leagues. Neesham will join renowned T20 overseas talents Asif Ali, Shadab Khan, Faheem Ashraf, and Zak Crawley at the Hurricanes.Apart from the aforementioned players, the Kiwi will also rub shoulders with some exceptional Australian stars Tim David, Paddy Dooley, Nathan Ellis, Caleb Jewell, Ben McDermott, Riley Meredith, Mitch Owen, Joel Paris, Wil Parker, D’Arcy Short, Billy Stanlake, Chris Tremain, Matthew Wade, and Mac Wright at the Tasmania based franchise.“I’m really excited to be involved with the Big Bash for the first time this year. I’ve heard great things about the Hurricanes setup, and the list this year looks incredibly strong, so to be able to play even a small part in what I hope will be a successful tournament for the franchise is a really great opportunity for me," Jimmy Neesham was quoted saying in an official statement by the Hobart Hurricanes.Hobart Hurricanes have failed to lay a claim to the prestigious BBL trophy in the previous 11 editions and will be hoping to break the duck in the upcoming season. Neesham, who has represented New Zealand in 60 T20Is, scoring 688 runs at an impressive strike rate of 159.62, is looking forward to plying his trade in the BBL and making new friends along the way."A lot of people say Tasmania is a bit like a mini New Zealand, so I’m looking forward to getting over there, meeting the guys, and playing the role that is asked of me for the team,” the Kiwi all-rounder added.© 2013 - 2022 CricTracker Pvt Ltd All rights reserved.
