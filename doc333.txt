Follow us onIndia have announced a 17-member squad for the ODI series against the Bangla Tigers, which starts on December 4. The senior trio of Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul, and Virat Kohli have returned to the international fold after being rested for the New Zealand tour. The selectors have also included some exciting uncapped players such as  Kuldeep Sen, Rajat Patidar, and Rahul Tripathi in the team.The last time Bangladesh hosted India for an ODI series was way back in 2015 and the Bangla Tigers stood tall, clinching the series 2-1. Rohit & co. have a well-rounded squad and would look to vindicate themselves this time around. However, it will be interesting what starting XI the team management decides to go with when the Men in Blue take the stage alongside Tamim Iqbal & co.Rohit Sharma is one of the finest opening batters in world cricket and has amassed a truckload of runs in both the white-ball formats. In the ODIs, the 35-year-old has featured in 233 matches and scored 9376 runs at a strike rate of 89.18. When it comes to the shortest format, he has scored 3853 runs in 148 games at a strike rate of 139.24.The flamboyant batter has all the shots in the book and can dismantle any bowling attack with his strokeplay. However, Rohit was not at his best at the recently culminated T20 World Cup 2022 and could manage mere 116 runs in six games at a strike rate of 106.42. The veteran batter would like to redeem himself in the upcoming ODI series against Bangladesh and put on a show with the bat.Besides Rohit’s batting might, the ace batter is an astute tactician of the game and has displayed his terrific leadership skills in the Indian Premier League and also the international arena. So, when India take on the Bangla Tigers, the onus will again be on the Nagpur-born to lead his side to a series win.© 2013 - 2022 CricTracker Pvt Ltd All rights reserved.
