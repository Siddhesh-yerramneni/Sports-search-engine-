Follow us onPreviewPakistan will face the challenge of Zimbabwe in Match 24 of the T20 World Cup 2022 on Thursday in Perth. Pakistan are coming to this game after losing to India in a cliffhanger. They did all right with the bat to score 160 on the board but faltered when they could not defend the attack. The likes of Shan Masood and Haris Rauf will be the top players for the team.
