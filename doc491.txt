Pakistan defeated India in the last game in the Asia Cup by five wickets after suffering a defeat in the first one by the same margin.India lost the last time they faced Pakistan in the T20 World Cup by a huge margin of ten wickets. The Indian batters failed to pose a threat against the Pakistani bowlers and failed to post a challenging total in that game. Shaheen Shah Afridi played a key role for the team and also won the Player of the Match award for his bowling spell of three for 31. He sustained a knee injury before the start of the Asia Cup in August and missed the entire tournament followed by the seven-match T20I series against England. He, however, made a return to the side for the warm-up games against England and Afghanistan. After failing to pick a wicket against England, he returned with a figure of two for 29 against Afghanistan.India will be missing the services of Ravindra Jadeja and Jasprit Bumrah in this tournament. Mohammad Shami has replaced Bumrah in the side and played a significant role for the team in the warm-up game against Australia. The Indian batting unit has looked very sharp in the last few months and it will be interesting to see how they will respond to the bowlers this time.Match InformationICC Men's T20 World Cup, 23 Oct 2022, Sun, 1:30 PM IST,  MelbourneProbable Playing XIIndiaRohit Sharma, KL Rahul(C), Virat Kohli, SA Yadav, HH Pandya, Axar Patel, Dinesh Karthik, Yuzvendra Chahal, B Kumar, HV Patel, M ShamiBench : Deepak Hooda, Rishabh Pant, Ravichandran Ashwin, JJ Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh, S Iyer, Ravi Bishnoi, Shardul Thakur, Mohammed SirajPakistanBabar Azam(C), Asif Ali, Haider Ali, Shan Masood, SH Khan, Iftikhar Ahmed, Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Rizwan, Haris Rauf, Naseem Shah, S AfridiBench : Khushdil Shah, M Hasnain, Mohammad Wasim, Usman Qadir, Shahnawaz Dahani, FK Zaman, Mohammad HarisInjury and availability newsWeather ReportWin PredictionPitch ConditionAvg 1st Inning ScorePitch ReportPlayer PicksMohammad Rizwan PAK |  WKHe is the number one ranked batter in the T20I rankings and has been one of the in-form batters for Pakistan in recent times.
