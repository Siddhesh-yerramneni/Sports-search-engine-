Notably, this is only Namibia's fifth win over the Test-playing nation and can very much give them the confidence to do well in the remaining games of the tournament. The captain spoke about the importance of the win and hailed the coaching staff for their continuous support while speaking at the post-match conference.“Incredible journey, last year was a special experience for us. We've started with a great win, but lot of work to do throughout this tournament still. It's been a historic day for us. The opening day has been quite special but we want to kick on from here and qualify for the Super 12 stage,” he said."We understand the bigger picture as well. Credit goes to Pierre (de Bruyn) the way he has installed coaching to this team, one that's a winning culture and one that sticks together. With the limited resources, I don't think there's anyone else that could run such a tight ship,” the 27-year-old added.© 2013 - 2022 CricTracker Pvt Ltd All rights reserved.
